How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff/fc points me to the relevant lines

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    quickly go back to previous version, avoid renaming files to store previous
    versions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    package changes into logical pieces

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    They have version control for a different purpose. Tracking isolated files
    vs tracking related files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log --stat returns aggregated stats 
    git diff id1 id2 shows different lines between two versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can always go back to the previous version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    clone code from github, change something and 
    test if notepad++ works for the commit messages
