When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	If I want to share my code with the world or if I'd like other developers to improve my code.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I may not want to publish commits for features which are not finished, yet.
