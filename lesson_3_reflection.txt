When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	If I want to share my code with the world or if I'd like other developers to improve my code.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I may not want to publish commits for features which are not finished, yet.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks are clones from one github repository to the other
	clones are copies of a local or github repository including the entire history
	branches are labels for commits within the same repository
	we use forks to develop an existing code within our own repository
	we use clones to work on a local copy of an existing repository
	we use branches to introduce a new feature within an existing local repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	you can work offline to resolve merge conflicts later on the local repository
